# 🖼️ Text-to-Image Generation System

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the intersection of **deep learning and creativity**, leveraging **GANs and Diffusion Models** to transform **text descriptions into high-quality, semantically rich images**. By integrating **advanced generative architectures**, it enhances both **fidelity and contextual accuracy**, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven visual synthesis.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Fine-Tuned GAN Model** – Optimized a **conditional GAN** with **diffusion-based enhancements** to generate **coherent and realistic images** from text.  
- ✅ **State-of-the-Art Generative Models** – Utilized **GANs and Diffusion Models** to improve **image quality, realism, and contextual alignment**.  
- ✅ **Dataset Diversity** – Trained on **diverse datasets** to handle **complex text prompts** and produce visually meaningful results.  
- ✅ **Applications in AI & Art** – Supports **digital art, content creation, and AI-assisted design**, broadening the scope of **text-to-image synthesis**.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Models Used**: Conditional GANs, Diffusion Models  
- **Tools**: Google Colab, NumPy, OpenCV
